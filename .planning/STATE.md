# Project State

## Project Reference

See PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-10). Core value: make search indexing feel native to Ecto and ergonomic for Phoenix teams without hiding operational reality. Current focus: approved v1.43 ScrypathOps UI refinement; Phase 173 is complete and Phase 174 is next to discuss and plan.

## Current Position

Phase: 174 — Recovery Entry and Diagnosis
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-10 — Phase 173 complete, transitioned to Phase 174
Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (1/5 phases; 4/9 plans complete)

Planning tag `v1.42` points to this source. PR93 merged the completed archive before this final run.
- All completion/audit/archive records preceded that attestation. Its source and retained preview worktree remain unchanged. The original dated handoff commit was planning-only. Later user-directed local UI follow-ups are recorded separately below; they are not part of the archived Phase172 plans, verification, or exact-source receipt. The archived v1.42 tracker's `state_head` identifies that attested input; the current v1.43 header serves GSD freshness tracking and does not extend the v1.42 receipt. The collected receipt is retained at `reference/v1.42-final-receipt.json`; its immutable artifact IDs/digests remain useful after the hosted artifacts expire.

## Post-Archive Follow-Up

- After the v1.42 receipt, commits `698013c`, `b10ba7d`, `7abb4c9`, and `961ecf4` addressed small operator UI issues: command-palette selection, refresh icon persistence, refresh feedback and breadcrumb cleanup, local hot reload, and theme-aware shared toast colors. These are committed on `planning/next-milestone-handoff`; they do not reopen Phase172.
- The preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4012/admin/search` was used for local browser review. The final toast styling was checked in light and dark themes and assets rebuilt. No hosted CI or milestone-level verification is claimed for these follow-ups.
- This user-requested local follow-up uses `/health` and “Search health” while retaining `/posture` as a compatibility redirect, standardizes refresh buttons, checked-time placement, and success feedback through one shared control, keeps failed-reason counts visible, and removes routine timestamp-copy controls. It also removes the unnecessary summary wrapper panel. The mounted preview rendered the Control Room, Search health, Failed sync work, and Sync and drift refresh controls and their action-specific feedback; the legacy path reached `/admin/search/health`. No automated tests or milestone-level verification were run or claimed for this follow-up.
- The current copy pass uses the Scrypath logo alone in the operator shell, aligns navigation, breadcrumbs, and page titles to “Search health,” “Failed sync work,” “Sync and drift,” and “Search,” and makes links name their actual destinations. The refreshed local preview was reviewed; no automated tests were run.
- On 2026-10-06, direct Search health feedback prompted a local layout correction: removed duplicate Impeccable preview wrappers from the shared panel, restored 24px section spacing, replaced sentence-length action links with concise shared controls and supporting prose, removed redundant section/diagnostic panels, and preserved full module names and readable timestamps. The broader recovery → verification → saved-check refinement sequence is captured in `reference/OPERATOR-UI-REFINEMENT.md`; no active phase was created.
- Local verification for the current changes: Ops `mix precommit` passed 233 tests and 2 doctests with zero failures; token contrast passed with zero AA failures (34 AAA advisory findings). Live desktop and 390px mobile review covered light and dark themes, measured 24px section gaps and 40px action controls, and found no horizontal overflow. Diagnostic subgroups are transparent and full identifiers/timestamps remain readable. The revised browser depth spec parsed/listed 33 tests; the full browser matrix was not executed or the feedback preview reseeded. These local results are not hosted exact-SHA evidence and do not extend the archived Phase172 receipt. The temporary test database was removed after validation; preview data remains intact.
- Later on 2026-10-06, the maintainer identified shared visual defects: shell gradients, broad yellow warning fills/outlines, green zero-error metrics, double theme selection, quiet-action hover colors, and dense last-success timestamps. The refinement brief now puts shared visual foundations first and records concrete acceptance criteria, including human-readable operational times and truthful clipboard/toast feedback. This follow-up edits planning/design context only; no UI implementation, new test run, commit, or milestone activation is claimed.

## Durable Defaults

Use shared tokens/components and concise domain terms; preserve schema context and distinguish accepted work from exact task/document evidence. Keep inaccessible/missing/remote/expired evidence unknown and retain failure history. Automate recurring checks in existing economical CI lanes. Direct screenshot review supplements executable layout/focus/contrast checks; no paid judge or routine human UAT. Reopen only for named new evidence. See `reference/OPERATOR-UI-QUALITY.md` and PROJECT.md.

Always finish a phase/milestone handoff with the completed phase, the exact next GSD command, why it advances work, and whether context can be cleared. The persistent policy is PROJECT.md's **GSD handoff default**.

### Historical Boundaries

- v1.41 is archived with 9/9 requirements, 4/4 phases, 6/6 integration paths, and 3/3 end-to-end flows complete. Its audit accepts nonblocking Nyquist validation-record debt for Phases 168–170; Phase 171 is validated.
- The original Phase 170 decision remains **NOT READY** at [issue #86 comment 5940381507](https://github.com/szTheory/scrypath/issues/86#issuecomment-5940381507). The later separate assessment is **READY** at [comment 5955742805](https://github.com/szTheory/scrypath/issues/86#issuecomment-5955742805), within its stated limits; inherited assumptions EA-167-01–EA-167-07 remain unresolved.
- Current GSD tracking records Phase 170 at 8/8 through its authorized planning-side replacement. The frozen `8c271…` snapshot remains historical 17/18 with original bytes preserved. See `milestones/v1.41-phases/170-documentation-and-readiness-closeout/170-08-TRACKING-REPLACEMENT.md` and `170-POST-FREEZE-RECONCILIATION.md`. Do not rerun Phase 170.
- Scrypath 0.3.14 publication/parity and exact-main closeout are recorded in PROJECT.md and the v1.41 archive. Those receipts and older readiness cutoffs remain source-bounded; they do not verify changed v1.42 UI behavior. Historical “What's next” statements describe archive-time posture.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Product scope | New workflows, core APIs, backend abstraction, host authorization product, broader matrices | Separate concrete evidence and scope required | 2026-10-03 | v1.42 |
| Visual scope | Shared color/surface token revision versus framework replacement/wholesale CSS rewrite | Concrete 2026-10-06 feedback reopens shared visual tokens; framework replacement and unrelated rewrites remain deferred. See the refinement brief. | 2026-10-06 | Post-v1.42 |
| Verification topology | New required CI job or paid visual-judge service | Existing economical lanes are the default | 2026-10-03 | v1.42 |
| Historical planning | Nyquist validation records for Phases 168–170 | Accepted nonblocking v1.41 audit debt; no phase replay | 2026-10-02 | v1.41 |

## Preview and Cleanup

Preview http://127.0.0.1:4012/admin/search remains healthy under Compose `scrypath-ui-v142`, without reseeding. Container `scrypath-ui-v142-web-1` bind-mounts this checkout (`/Users/jon/projects/scrypath` → `/app`), so `:4012` is the correct hot-reloading preview for current source. Stop from `examples/scrypath_ecommerce` with `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=scrypath-ui-v142 WEB_PORT=4012 docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml down`; preserve volumes.

Both disposable verification projects and their owned networks/volumes were removed after artifact collection. Unrelated services remain untouched. The previous normal-checkout state at11ab1c9 is preserved on `gsd/v1.38-cleanup-merged`, with its existing2026-10-02 stash. On2026-10-04 the clean normal checkout was safely switched to a new branch from final main for this planning-only handoff; the old branch and stash were not reset or applied.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-10-11T00:54:47.588Z
Stopped at: Phase 174 context gathered; ready for UI contract
Resume file: .planning/phases/174-recovery-entry-and-diagnosis/174-CONTEXT.md

Phase 173 is complete in this isolated worktree at source SHA `b12a7c47157b4fb88b05237b7e2525d11896fd59`. All four plans and OPUX-09–OPUX-15 passed goal verification (41/41 plan truths); Ops precommit and root `mix verify.ops_ui` each passed 246 tests plus 2 doctests, the focused PostureLive suite passed 15 tests, and mounted/standalone shell and copy browser suites passed 14/14 and 10/10. Security review closed 9/9 threats; code review had zero findings; the UI audit scored 24/24 with no human review required. These are local exact-source results; no hosted source receipt is claimed. See the four plan summaries, `173-VERIFICATION.md`, `173-SECURITY.md`, `173-REVIEW.md`, `173-UI-REVIEW.md`, and `173-VALIDATION.md`.

Next command: `$gsd-discuss-phase 174`. Phase 174 (Recovery Entry and Diagnosis) is the next approved, dependency-ready phase and has no context/UI contract/implementation plan yet; discussion resolves its scope before the UI contract and plan. Automatic phase chaining is disabled. Continue from worktree `/Users/jon/projects/scrypath/.claude/worktrees/agent-p173-01-retry-1791665855` on branch `worktree-agent-p173-01-retry-1791665855` so the completed source and planning record remain together. The root checkout and retained preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4012/admin/search` were not modified by this run. Context can be cleared after the planning closeout commit is recorded.

Keep the v1.43 execution order 173 → 174 → 175 → 176 → 177. Phase 176's five checked plans remain gated behind Phases 173–175; no Phase 176 implementation or product verification is claimed. Preserve the intentional adaptive model routing in `.planning/config.json` and do not replay Phase 172/170 or extend archived source receipts.
