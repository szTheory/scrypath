# Phase 173: Code Review Report

**Reviewed:** 2026-10-13T01:25:47Z
**Depth:** standard  
**Files Reviewed:** 28
**Status:** clean

## Summary

Reviewed all 28 supplied Phase 173 source paths, including the core timestamp normalization and status projection, both Ops entrypoints and their generated assets, the posture LiveView and presentation components, and the disposable browser fixture/verification harness. I found no correctness, security, or maintainability defects in the scoped implementation. Existing tests and scripts were inspected as source; no tests were run for this review.

## Narrative Findings (AI reviewer)

No findings.
